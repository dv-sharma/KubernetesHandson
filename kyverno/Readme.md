Kyverno is a policy engine designed to enforce security and compliance within your Kubernetes cluster. It acts like an admission controller, intercepting requests to create or modify resources and checking them against your defined policies. Here's a breakdown with some practical examples:

Key Features:

Uses familiar YAML syntax for policies, leveraging existing tools like kubectl and git for management.
Offers various policy actions: validation, mutation, generation, and cleanup of Kubernetes resources.
Verifies image signatures and artifacts to secure the software supply chain.
Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for policy testing and resource validation.
Practical Examples:
